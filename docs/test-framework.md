# Automated Testing Framework

## Testing Layers

The automated testing strategy is implemented across multiple layers:

1. **Unit Tests (Jest + React Testing Library)**

   - Individual component testing
   - Utility function testing

2. **Integration Tests (Playwright)**

   - Component interaction testing
   - API integration testing
   - Cross-component functionality

3. **End-to-End Tests (Playwright)**

   - Full user journey testing
   - Cross-browser compatibility
   - Real-world scenario testing

4. **Accessibility Tests (axe-playwright)**
   - WCAG compliance testing
   - Color contrast verification

## Test Organization

Tests are organized in the following directory structure:

```
tests/
├── e2e/                 # End-to-end tests
│   ├── Dashboard.e2e.test.js
│   └── Portfolio.e2e.test.js
├── integration/         # Integration tests
│   ├── dashboard.integration.test.js
│   └── portfolio.integration.test.js
├── lib/                # Test utilities and helpers
│   └── a11y-helpers.js
└── __fixtures__/       # Test data fixtures
```

_Unit tests are colocated with the components they test._

## Continuous Integration

Automated tests can be run in a CI/CD pipeline by creating a GitHub Actions workflow. The workflow can be triggered on push events to the main branch and run the test suite against the application.

```yaml
name: Run Tests

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: Run tests
        run: npm run test
```

## Test Data Management

- Use of fixtures for consistent test data
- Mock API responses for predictable testing
- Isolation between test runs

## Best Practices

1. **Test Independence**

   - Each test should be self-contained
   - No dependencies between tests
   - Clean state before and after each test

2. **Maintainability**

   - Reusable test utilities
   - Clear test descriptions
   - Consistent naming conventions

3. **Reliability**

   - Retry mechanisms for flaky tests
   - Proper wait strategies
   - Robust selectors
   - Error screenshots and videos

4. **Performance**
   - Parallel test execution
   - Test sharding for E2E tests
   - Efficient setup and teardown
